* Other Packages

This is a directory to save some packages what are not in ELPA or MELPA.

To use EAF, you need to clone EAF:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework.git ~/.emacs.d/other-packages/ --depth=1
#+end_src

Or clone from fastgit:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://hub.fastgit.org/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework.git ~/.emacs.d/other-packages/ --depth=1
#+end_src
